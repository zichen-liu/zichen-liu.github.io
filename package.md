I helped my advisor, Dr. Catherine M. Crespi, develop an R package for power and sample size calculations. We made sure that this package was as user-friendly as possible by including a robust parameter checking suite, detailed documentation (including error messages), and the ability to solve for different parameters as needed (e.g. a single function can solve for power or sample size). This R package accompanies the textbook she wrote, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Power-and-Sample-Size-in-R/Crespi/p/book/9781138591622?srsltid=AfmBOorog9XXacgx78jtLMM81SXF9g1v1YkP0d2XH2y0l7-3v_GgSNrZ"><b>Power and Sample Size in R</b></a>.
