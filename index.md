Hello! My name is Zichen Liu (*zee-chen lee-oo*) and I'm a (bio)statistician.

I grew up in the Bay Area of California. Here's a quick overview of my professional journey:

- **2014-2018**: I attended Pomona College and pursued a BA in chemistry
- **2018-2021**: I moved to Seattle to work at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation as a data professional
- **2020-2022**: I stayed at the University of Washington to pursue my MS in biostatistics
- **2022-Now**: I'm a PhD student in biostatistics at UCLA
 
I have a variety of hobbies such as indoor rock climbing, playing video games (notably Teamfight Tactics), and reviewing horror movies on Letterboxd.
