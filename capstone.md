My classmates from the UW biostatistics MS program, [Hantong](https://hantongh.github.io/), [Taylor](https://tdkeating.github.io/), [Niki](https://nikipetrakos.github.io/), and I, had the pleasure of working together with epidemiologists from Public Health -- Seattle and King County on the topic of Housing and Urban Development.

Although this was just our capstone project, we extended our work into a publication: [Associations Between Exit Type From Federal Housing Assistance and Subsequent Homelessness](https://doi.org/10.1080/10511482.2023.2243260).

Below is the slide deck we presented to the biostatistics department and local public housing experts. It was very rewarding to know that our research was valuable to those who worked directly with the populations in need.

The four of us were additionally featured on the UW biostatistics [department website](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/stories/ms-capstone-students-contribute-public-health-solutions) for our work.
